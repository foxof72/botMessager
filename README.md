<h1>botMessenger</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Bot Messenger is a project created by John Williams using the [tweepy python libary](http://www.tweepy.org/).  This 
project is designed for people who have both a twitter bot and a "personal" twitter account.  Simply put, this allows 
your bot to direct message (DM) your personal account so that you can be alerted to things like changes in followers, 
errors and other actions without having to be constantly checking your bot.

<h2>Using botMessenger</h2>
Bot Messenger is designed to work with your current twitter bot.  You'll need a bot already working to use it, using the 
tweepy library in Python.  So before you can use Bot Messenger, make sure you have the following:
* A twitter bot, built in Python
* The keys for your twitter bot, both consumer and access (keep these secret!)
* Stoke!
